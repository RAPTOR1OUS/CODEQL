 * `A0-1-1` - address a number of false positive issues:
   * Exclude compiler-generated variables, such as those generated for range-based for loops.
   * Exclude variables in uninstantiated templates, for which we have no precise data on uses.
   * Deviations should now be applied to the useless assignment instead of the variable itself.
